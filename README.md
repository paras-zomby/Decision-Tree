# The C++ implement of Decision-Tree

This repo impl Decision Tree algorithm using C++ language, 
and it is also a homework of my colloge lesson: Machine 
Learning. My teacher asked us impl a decision tree using id3 
to decides how to pick nodes.

At first I chose C++ because I think the type-issue of C++ c 
an be solved using template, and I perfer to use C++ 
usually. However, when i start, i find that it is really harder than i thought! what can i do is just learning while coding. i firt use C++ template metaprograming in this proj, and try to impl some algorithm recursively.
